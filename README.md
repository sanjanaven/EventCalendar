# EventCalendar
The purpose of [Event Calendar](https://sanjanaven.github.io/EventCalendar/) is for users to be able to create events and add them to their schedules. 

The top of the page features the title of the site, and a short description. Below, users can make up to 10 events at once. For each event, users can input an event name, event description and pick the month and day using the dropdowns. Clicking the "save" button will save the event. Users can delete an event by selecting the "delete" button. There is also the ability to find examples of events by selecting the "Find Events" button, which has external links to various events that users can find in their area.

We used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to code this website. The bootstrap CSS framework was heavily used to create the user interface for the website.
