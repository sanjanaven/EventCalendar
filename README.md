# EventCalendar
[Event Calendar](https://sanjanaven.github.io/EventCalendar/).
Event Calendar's purpose is for users to be able to create events and add them to their schedules. 

The top of the page features the title of the site, and a short description. Below, users can make up to 10 events at once. For each event, users can input an event name, event description and pick the month and day using the dropdowns. Clicking the "save" button will save the event. 

We used HTML and CSS to code this website.
